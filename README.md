# Morphir

Morphir is a library of tools that works to capture business logic as data.

For the first time, business logic can be shared, stored, translated and visualised, all with the reliability of standardisation ensured in the Morphir framework.

## What is it?

A set of tools for integrating technologies. Morphir is composed of a library of tools that facilitate the digitisation of business logic into multiple different languages & platforms. The Morphir framework is unique too in that facilities elements of automation and conversion that were previously unavailable in the field of finance-tech.

## Why is it important?

Makes business logic portable. Business logic digitised provides distinct advantages: capacity for movement across departments and fields & the ability to be converted to new languages and applications.

## How does it work?

Defines a standard format for storing and sharing business logic. A clear set of standards and format is in-place from the input/output, allowing for coherent structure.

## What are the benefits?

### ✔️ Eliminates technical debt risk

> _Refactoring code libraries is often a harmful and time-sensitive issue for businesses, Morphir ensure the standards introduced from input eliminate delays at deployment._

### ✔️ Increases agility

> _Adaptability and usability are key concepts of the Morphir framework, business logic can now move with the code, be easily understood and adopted, in an ever-developing eco-system._

### ✔️ Ensures correctness

> _Certifying that specified functions behave as intended from input to output is assured through the Morphir library / tool chain._

### ✔️ Disseminates information through automation

> _Morphir’s automated processing helps disseminate information which otherwise may not be understood or shared at all, a useful tool when brining elements of business logic to conversation outside of its immediate audience (i.e developers)._

# Development setup

Morphir is a collection of tools. Each tool is in its own repo with its own installation instructions. The main development tools, and the best place to get started, are currently in [Morphir Elm](https://github.com/finos/morphir-elm).

## Usage example

Morphir tools can be used to optimize a wide range of development tasks. For example, Morphir can be used to define and automated development of an entire service. The [Morphir Dapr](https://github.com/finos/morphir-dapr) project is example of this.

Another good use of Morphir is to define shared rules than can be used across heterogeneous systems. This can be useful for initiatives like open-source Reg Tech models that are shared across firms. [Morphir LCR](https://github.com/finos/morphir-examples/tree/master/src/Morphir/Sample/LCR) presents a good example of this.

More Morphir examples can be found at [Morphir Examples](https://github.com/finos/morphir-examples/).
