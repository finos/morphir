# Morphir Documentation Writing Style Guide

This guide establishes writing standards for Morphir documentation.

## Voice and Tone

### Be Clear and Direct
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid jargon; explain technical terms when first used
- Write short sentences and paragraphs
- Get to the point quickly

### Be Helpful, Not Condescending
- Assume intelligence but not prior knowledge
- Explain "why" as well as "how"
- Anticipate questions and confusion points

### Be Consistent
- Use the same terms throughout
- Follow established patterns in existing docs
- Maintain consistent formatting

## Grammar and Style

### Active Voice
Prefer active voice over passive:
- **Good:** "Morphir generates the code"
- **Avoid:** "The code is generated by Morphir"

### Second Person
Address the reader directly:
- **Good:** "You can configure..."
- **Avoid:** "One can configure..." or "The user can configure..."

### Present Tense
Use present tense for describing functionality:
- **Good:** "This command creates a new project"
- **Avoid:** "This command will create a new project"

### Imperative Mood for Instructions
Start instructions with verbs:
- **Good:** "Run the build command"
- **Avoid:** "You should run the build command"

## Formatting Standards

### Headings
- Use sentence case: "Getting started with Morphir"
- Keep headings concise (under 60 characters)
- Don't skip heading levels (H1 → H2 → H3)
- One H1 per document (usually from frontmatter title)

### Code Blocks
Always specify the language:
```elm
module Example exposing (..)
```

For shell commands:
```bash
morphir build
```

### Lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bullet points for non-sequential items
- Start each item with a capital letter
- Be consistent with punctuation (periods or no periods)

### Links
- Use descriptive link text
- **Good:** "See the [installation guide](./installation.md)"
- **Avoid:** "Click [here](./installation.md)"

### File Paths and Code
- Use backticks for inline code: `morphir.config`
- Use code blocks for multi-line code
- Format file paths as code: `docs/getting-started/`

## Document Structure

### Typical Structure

1. **Title** (from frontmatter or H1)
2. **Introduction** (1-2 paragraphs explaining the topic)
3. **Prerequisites** (if applicable)
4. **Main Content** (organized with clear headings)
5. **Examples** (practical demonstrations)
6. **Summary/Next Steps** (for longer documents)

### Introduction Paragraph
Every document should start with a brief introduction that:
- States what the document covers
- Explains who should read it
- Sets expectations

Example:
> This guide explains how to install Morphir on your system. By the end, you'll have a working Morphir development environment and be ready to create your first project.

## Technical Writing Best Practices

### Show, Don't Just Tell
Include concrete examples:
- Code samples that can be copied and run
- Screenshots for UI-related content
- Before/after comparisons

### Progressive Disclosure
- Start with the basics
- Add complexity gradually
- Link to advanced topics rather than explaining everything

### Error Handling
When documenting processes that can fail:
- Mention common errors
- Provide troubleshooting steps
- Link to help resources

### Versioning
- Specify versions when relevant
- Note deprecated features
- Document breaking changes

## Terminology

### Consistent Terms
Use these terms consistently:

| Use | Don't Use |
|-----|-----------|
| Morphir IR | IR, intermediate representation |
| Morphir SDK | SDK, the SDK |
| command-line | commandline, command line |
| backend | back-end, back end |

### Capitalization
- Morphir (always capitalized)
- Morphir IR (both words capitalized)
- Commands use lowercase: `morphir build`

## Accessibility

### Images
- Always include alt text
- Don't rely solely on images for critical information
- Describe charts and diagrams in text

### Color
- Don't use color alone to convey meaning
- Ensure sufficient contrast

### Structure
- Use proper heading hierarchy for screen readers
- Provide text alternatives for complex content
