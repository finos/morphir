## 🎯 Getting Started with Modeling

If you're new to modeling in Morphir:

1. **Start with [Modeling Overview](modeling-guides/modeling-overview.md)** to understand the basics
2. **Read [What Makes a Good Domain Model](modeling-guides/what-makes-a-good-domain-model.md)** for best practices
3. **Choose a domain-specific guide** (e.g., [Modeling in Finance](modeling-guides/modeling-finance.md) if applicable)
4. **Follow [Application Modeling](modeling-guides/application-modeling.md)** to build a complete application

## 💡 Key Principles

When modeling in Morphir, remember:

- **Business logic first**: Focus on the domain, not implementation
- **Pure functions**: All logic should be expressed as pure functions
- **Type safety**: Use Morphir's type system to catch errors early
- **Testability**: Write tests alongside your models

## 🛠️ Using the CLI

The Morphir command-line tools are essential for:

- **`morphir-elm make`** - Translate Elm sources to Morphir IR
- **`morphir-elm gen`** - Generate code from Morphir IR
- **`morphir-elm develop`** - Launch the development UI

See [Command-Line Tools](cli-tools/command-line-tools.md) for complete documentation.
