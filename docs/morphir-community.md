# Morphir Community

**Morphir's success will depend on its community.**

While this might be obvious, we want to state that up front. The open-sourcing of Morphir was based on the successes that we had with it in Morgan Stanley.

Those successes demonstrate the potential that Morphir has. We are contributing, and will continue to contribute, useful tools to the Morphir ecosystem.

We recognize that there is a vast difference between building tools for a company's controlled infrastructure and making them robust for the general open-source community.

Filling that gap and moving beyond our own vision will require a broad Morphir community.

So as you browse the Morphir project and read about possible uses, view these more of indications of potential instead of polished products. It's all about the Morphir community.

If you see the same potential that we have, we hope you join us.
