# Jekyll configuration for GitHub Pages
#
# The main documentation site is built by Docusaurus and deployed via Netlify.
# GitHub Pages with Jekyll processes the raw repository for direct browsing.
#
# We exclude directories containing Docusaurus/MDX content that is incompatible
# with Jekyll's Liquid template processing (e.g., JSX-style {{}} syntax).

exclude:
  - docs/
  - website/
  - node_modules/
  - vendor/
  - Gemfile
  - Gemfile.lock
  - "*.mdx"
