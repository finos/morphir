# Pattern Combinators

Elm has built-in pattern-matching support but it has some limitations:

  - patterns can only be used within a case expression and patterns need
    to be exhaustive so you cannot define a single pattern in isolation
  - patterns can only be composed within a case expression so you cannot
    reuse complex patterns across different functions or modules

Fortunately it's relatively easy to get around this and provide a convenient
API that addresses those limitations. The key is to recognise that patterns
are partial functions which can be modeled as a function `a -> Maybe b` in Elm.

@docs Pattern

Using this approach we can create a pattern combinator library that allows
us to compose larger patterns from smaller ones and capture the result in a
stand-alone function that can be reused anywhere.

The process starts by defining some basic functions that allows us to match
the leaves in a pattern:

@docs matchAny, matchValue

Then we can move up a level and use combinators to build more complex patterns.
We provide some standard combinators for some types in `elm/core` here and
provide combinators for specific types in the module where the type is defined.

**Note**: Pattern combinators will always start with the word `match` so you
can search for the available combinators using that.
