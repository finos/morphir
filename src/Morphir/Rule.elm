{-| Rules are partial functions (or `Pattern`s) that return the same type of value as what
they match on.

@docs Rule


# Working with rules

You can create a rule from a pattern simply by making sure that the return type is the same
as the type that is being matched (`Pattern a a`). If your pattern maps to a different type
you can map it back using `Pattern.map`:
