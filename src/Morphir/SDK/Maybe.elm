module Morphir.SDK.Maybe exposing (..)

{-| This library fills a bunch of important niches in Elm. A `Maybe` can help
you with optional arguments, error handling, and records with optional fields.

{-| Provide a default value, turning an optional value into a normal
value. This comes in handy when paired with functions like
[`Dict.get`](Dict#get) which gives back a `Maybe`.

    withDefault 100 (Just 42) -- 42

    withDefault 100 Nothing -- 100

    withDefault "unknown" (Dict.get "Tom" Dict.empty) -- "unknown"

**Note:** This can be overused! Many cases are better handled by a `case`
expression. And if you end up using `withDefault` a lot, it can be a good sign
that a [custom type][ct] will clean your code up quite a bit!

{-| Transform a `Maybe` value with a given function:

    map sqrt (Just 9) == Just 3

    map sqrt Nothing == Nothing

    map sqrt (String.toFloat "9") == Just 3

    map sqrt (String.toFloat "x") == Nothing

-}
map : (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
map =
    Maybe.map


{-| Apply a function if all the arguments are `Just` a value.

    map2 (+) (Just 3) (Just 4) == Just 7

    map2 (+) (Just 3) Nothing == Nothing

    map2 (+) Nothing (Just 4) == Nothing

    map2 (+) (String.toInt "1") (String.toInt "123") == Just 124

    map2 (+) (String.toInt "x") (String.toInt "123") == Nothing

    map2 (+) (String.toInt "1") (String.toInt "1.3") == Nothing

-}
map2 : (a -> b -> value) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b -> Maybe value
map2 =
    Maybe.map2


{-| -}
map3 : (a -> b -> c -> value) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b -> Maybe c -> Maybe value
map3 =
    Maybe.map3


{-| -}
map4 : (a -> b -> c -> d -> value) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b -> Maybe c -> Maybe d -> Maybe value
map4 =
    Maybe.map4


{-| -}
map5 : (a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> value) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b -> Maybe c -> Maybe d -> Maybe e -> Maybe value
map5 =
    Maybe.map5


{-| Chain together many computations that may fail. It is helpful to see its
definition:

    andThen : (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
    andThen callback maybe =
        case maybe of
            Just value ->
                callback value

            Nothing ->
                Nothing

This means we only continue with the callback if things are going well. For
example, say you need to parse some user input as a month:

    parseMonth : String -> Maybe Int
    parseMonth userInput =
        String.toInt userInput
            |> andThen toValidMonth

    toValidMonth : Int -> Maybe Int
    toValidMonth month =
        if 1 <= month && month <= 12 then
            Just month

        else
            Nothing

In the `parseMonth` function, if `String.toInt` produces `Nothing` (because
the `userInput` was not an integer) this entire chain of operations will
short-circuit and result in `Nothing`. If `toValidMonth` results in `Nothing`,
again the chain of computations will result in `Nothing`.
