-- FUNCTION HELPERS


{-| Function composition, passing results along in the suggested direction. For
example, the following code checks if the square root of a number is odd:

    not << isEven << sqrt

You can think of this operator as equivalent to the following:

    (g << f) == (\x -> g (f x))

So our example expands out to something like this:

    \n -> not (isEven (sqrt n))

-}
composeLeft : (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
composeLeft g f x =
    g (f x)


{-| Function composition, passing results along in the suggested direction. For
example, the following code checks if the square root of a number is odd:

    sqrt >> isEven >> not

-}
composeRight : (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> c)
composeRight f g x =
    g (f x)


{-| Given a value, returns exactly the same value. This is called
[the identity function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function).
-}
identity : a -> a
identity x =
    Basics.identity x


{-| Create a function that _always_ returns the same value. Useful with
functions like `map`:

    List.map (always 0) [1,2,3,4,5] == [0,0,0,0,0]

    -- List.map (\_ -> 0) [1,2,3,4,5] == [0,0,0,0,0]
    -- always = (\x _ -> x)

-}
always : a -> b -> a
always a b =
    Basics.always a b
