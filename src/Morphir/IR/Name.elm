    , fromString, toTitleCase, toCamelCase, toSnakeCase, toHumanWords, toHumanWordsTitle
    )

{-| `Name` is an abstraction of human-readable identifiers made up of words. This abstraction
allows us to use the same identifiers across various naming conventions used by the different
frontend and backend languages Morphir integrates with.

    name = fromList [ "value", "in", "u", "s", "d" ]

    toTitleCase name --> "ValueInUSD"
    toCamelCase name --> "valueInUSD"
    toSnakeCase name --> "value_in_USD"


## Abbreviations

We frequently use abbreviations in a business context to be more concise.
From a naming perspective abbreviations are challanging because they are not real words and
behave slightly differently. In this module we treat abbreviations as a list of single-letter
words. This approach fits nicely into camel and title case naming conventions but when using
snake-case the direct translation would look unnatural:

    toSnakeCase name -- "value_in_u_s_d" ?

To resolve this and help creating human-readable strings we added functionality to turn
abbreviations into upper-case words. We treat any series of single letter words as an
abbreviation:

    toSnakeCase name --> "value_in_USD"

{-| Translate a string into a name by splitting it into words. The algorithm is designed
to work with most well-known naming conventions or mix of them. The general rule is that
consecutive letters and numbers are treated as words, upper-case letters and non-alphanumeric
characters start a new word.

    --> Name.fromList [ "foo", "bar", "baz", "123" ]
