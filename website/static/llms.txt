# Morphir

> Morphir is a library of tools that works to capture business logic
> as data in a language-agnostic intermediate representation (IR).
> It provides a type-safe, functional approach to defining and
> transforming business rules across multiple platforms.

Morphir enables you to write business logic once and deploy it to
multiple targets including Scala, TypeScript, Spark, and more.
The IR preserves full semantic information making it suitable for
analysis, optimization, and cross-platform code generation.
