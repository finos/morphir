Workspace Root Configuration (morphir.toml)\n\n```toml\n[morphir]\nversion = \"^3.0.0\"\n\n[workspace]\n# Existing fields\nroot = \"\"\noutput_dir = \".morphir\"\n\n# NEW: Member discovery via glob patterns\nmembers = [\n    \"packages/*\",           # All direct subdirs of packages/\n    \"libs/**\",              # Recursive: all subdirs under libs/\n    \"apps/*/frontend\",      # Nested pattern\n]\n\n# NEW: Exclude specific paths from member discovery\nexclude = [\n    \"packages/deprecated\",\n    \"**/testdata\",\n]\n\n# NEW: Default member to use when none specified (optional)\ndefault_member = \"packages/core\"\n\n# NEW: Shared configuration inherited by all members\n[workspace.defaults]\nsource_directory = \"src\"\n```\n\n## 2. Project Section (for member projects)\n\nMember projects use a `[project]` section in their morphir.toml:\n\n```toml\n# packages/core/morphir.toml\n\n[project]\n# Required: Project name - flexible format\n# Can be any valid identifier: \"my-project\", \"MyProject\", \"Morphir.Core\"\nname = \"morphir-core\"\n\n# Optional: Package version (can inherit from workspace)\nversion = \"1.0.0\"\n\n# Required: Directory containing source files (relative to project root)\nsource_directory = \"src\"\n\n# Required: Modules exposed in the public API\nexposed_modules = [\n    \"Types\",\n    \"SDK\",\n    \"IR\",\n]\n\n# Optional: Module prefix for Elm-style qualified names\n# If not set, derived from name or inferred from source structure\n# Use this for morphir-elm compatibility or explicit module namespacing\nmodule_prefix = \"Morphir.Core\"\n\n# Optional: Dependencies on other workspace members\n# dependencies = [\"morphir-sdk\"]\n```\n\n### Field Descriptions\n\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\n|-------|------|----------|-------------|\n| `name` | string | Yes | Project identifier (flexible: kebab-case, PascalCase, dot-separated, etc.) |\n| `version` | string | No | Semantic version, can use `workspace = true` to inherit |\n| `source_directory` | string | Yes | Source code location relative to project root |\n| `exposed_modules` | []string | Yes | Public modules (without module_prefix) |\n| `module_prefix` | string | No | Elm-style module prefix for qualified names (defaults to name if valid, otherwise derived) |\n\n### Name vs Module Prefix\n\n- **name**: Project identifier used for references, dependencies, and tooling. Flexible format.\n- **module_prefix**: Elm-style dotted prefix for module qualification. Used when generating IR or for morphir-elm compatibility.\n\nExamples:\n```toml\n# Modern style - explicit separation\nname = \"my-awesome-lib\"\nmodule_prefix = \"MyAwesome.Lib\"\n\n# Elm-compatible style - name doubles as prefix\nname = \"Morphir.SDK\"\n# module_prefix defaults to \"Morphir.SDK\" (valid Elm module name)\n\n# Simple project - auto-derived prefix\nname = \"utils\"\n# module_prefix defaults to \"Utils\" (PascalCase conversion)\n```\n\n## 3. morphir.json Compatibility (finos/morphir-elm)\n\nThe classic morphir.json format is automatically detected and mapped:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"My.Package\",\n    \"sourceDirectory\": \"src\",\n    \"exposedModules\": [\"Foo\", \"Bar\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Mapping to [project] Section\n\n| morphir.json | morphir.toml [project] |\n|--------------|------------------------|\n| `name` | `name` AND `module_prefix` (same value, since morphir.json names are always Elm-style) |\n| `sourceDirectory` | `source_directory` |\n| `exposedModules` | `exposed_modules` |\n\n### Detection Priority\n\n1. `morphir.toml` (preferred)\n2. `.morphir/morphir.toml`  \n3. `morphir.json` (legacy compatibility)\n\n## 4. Workspace Types\n\n### Virtual Workspace (no root project)\n\n```toml\n# Root morphir.toml - workspace only, no project\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\"packages/*\"]\n```\n\n### Root Package Workspace (workspace + project)\n\n```toml\n# Root morphir.toml - both workspace and project\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\"libs/*\"]\n\n[project]\nname = \"my-app\"\nmodule_prefix = \"MyApp\"\nsource_directory = \"src\"\nexposed_modules = [\"Main\"]\n```\n\n## 5. Directory Structure Examples\n\n### Multi-package Workspace\n\n```\nmy-workspace/\n├── morphir.toml              # [workspace] with members\n├── packages/\n│   ├── core/\n│   │   ├── morphir.toml      # [project] section\n│   │   └── src/\n│   ├── sdk/\n│   │   ├── morphir.toml\n│   │   └── src/\n│   └── deprecated/           # Excluded\n│       └── morphir.toml\n└── libs/\n    └── utils/\n        ├── morphir.json      # Legacy format supported\n        └── src/\n```\n\n### Hybrid with Root Project\n\n```\nmy-app/\n├── morphir.toml              # [workspace] + [project]\n├── src/                      # Root project sources\n└── libs/\n    ├── internal/\n    │   └── morphir.toml\n    └── shared/\n        └── morphir.json\n```\n\n## 6. Glob Pattern Specification\n\nPatterns follow Go's `filepath.Match` plus `**` for recursive matching:\n\n| Pattern | Matches |\n|---------|---------|\n| `*` | Any single path segment |\n| `**` | Zero or more path segments (recursive) |\n| `?` | Any single character |\n| `[abc]` | Character class |\n\nExamples:\n- `packages/*` → `packages/foo`, `packages/bar` (not `packages/foo/bar`)\n- `libs/**` → `libs/a`, `libs/a/b`, `libs/a/b/c`\n- `apps/*/frontend` → `apps/web/frontend`, `apps/mobile/frontend`\n\n## 7. Module Prefix Derivation\n\nWhen `module_prefix` is not explicitly set:\n\n1. If `name` is a valid Elm module name (PascalCase, dot-separated), use it directly\n2. Otherwise, convert `name` to PascalCase:\n   - `my-project` → `MyProject`\n   - `foo_bar` → `FooBar`\n   - `utils` → `Utils`\n\nThis ensures backward compatibility with morphir-elm while allowing modern naming conventions.\n\n## 8. Config Resolution\n\nWhen loading a workspace:\n\n1. Find workspace root (walk up looking for morphir.toml with [workspace])\n2. Resolve member globs against workspace root\n3. Apply exclude patterns\n4. For each matched directory:\n   a. Look for morphir.toml with [project]\n   b. Fall back to .morphir/morphir.toml\n   c. Fall back to morphir.json\n5. Derive module_prefix if not set\n6. Merge workspace.defaults into each project\n7.
