	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// genScalaCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	genScalaCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&scalaVersion, "scala-version", "s", "", "The specific version of Scala to generate code for")
}
