Arranging,5713,grn:/ms/pb/finance/arranging,Arranging,"Arranging is a Prime Brokerage application that provides enhanced leverage to clients by converting MSCO short and long positions into stock loans or borrows on PDS (Prime Dealer Services). The selection of long positions to use as collateral or borrows is optimized to benefit the firm. 

The core processing involves identifying positions that meet all business constraints and moving positions from MSCO to PDS via journals. It also involves supporting other activities that affect the PDS positions such as mark to market, trades and dividends.

The major inputs used in the system are pulled from Libra, RTM, Trades, Products, Pricing, Lexor, GIM, SAFE and Corporate actions.  The major downstream consumers of Arranging activity are Libra, RTM, GIM, PAS, SAFE, Stock Loan and Debit Prediction.

The primary users are Prime Brokerage Finance and Prime Brokerage Margin Operations.

The system takes OTC trade and cash flow data feeds from trade booking / risk systems and provides consolidated netting, payment affirmation, electronic cash flow matching, journaling and cancel/correct functionality.  Magnet is based on an STP-with-exception-based workflow philosophy.  Magnet's prime purpose is to provide operational workflow to prevent settlement breaks from occurring, while providing a single consolidated audit trail linking risk system generated cashflows with actual settlement instructions.  Magnet data is used by Pari to automate investigation and resolution of settlement breaks when they do occur. 

Some of the functions Magnet provides are described briefly below : 
Netting - Auto netting is the application of client based netting preference to produce nets at various levels of granularity.  Manual netting allows nets to be crafted by operations in any shape of the underlying cashflows.  Splitting allows payments to be created in any shape according to restrictive rules to prevent manual payments being created.  
Central settlement involves interfacing with central providers such as DTCC for Credit Derivatives and CLS for FX in order to make net payments to the provider to reflect the net obligation across all participating banks.
Affirmation - Affirmation is a broad term that covers a number of functions.  Vanilla Affirmation is where a Morgan Stanley rep speaks to a client to affirm cashflow and payment amounts.  Affirmation can occur via external matching services such as DTCC Pay/Rec or can be automatic based on confirmation state of a trade and netting preference.  Magnet connects to external client facing tools via client link to allow STP of client affirmations.  Delivery Instructions are affirmed along with cashflows and hence the derivation and assignment of these is considered part of the function.",Jyoti Khetan,otcps_dev,http://taisc.webfarm.ms.com/ui/#/asset/7250,http://magnet
