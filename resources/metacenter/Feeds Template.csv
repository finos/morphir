Pending Trades,48,Feed,Active,"​Broker dealer pending trades
New pending trades are going to resolve following two business problems. 
Pending Balance Pending Balance is one of the key areas causing the material BTR (Book To Reported) break and Finance is unable to get reliable pending trades data that can tie out to General Ledger (10Q TD Receivable/Payables).New pending trade’s data with various exclusion rules uncovered by now is proven to be materially reconciled to the ledger at ME for global Morgan Stanley scope (FHC). It would also have additional benefit as below: •      Potential additional netting by counterparty for FED 009 reporting•      Average pending balance requirement in Daily Balance Sheet•      Assess external gross-ups that may be required for Basel SLR


LST (Long Settle Trades) 
LST (for US Balance Sheet reporting) is unsettled securities transactions with a contractual settlement that is longer than the market standard for the particular instrument. Despite the nature of instrument as cash securities, LST requires the similar accounting treatment to derivatives.
Currently firm’s subledger system (PX/Librix) treats LST same as other regular trades and that has to be corrected in the ledger for the balance sheet reporting.
New pending trades include the logic to identifying LST trades considering the regional holiday information as well as market standard for the instrument and can be used as the base population for LST adjustment.
 
In the later phase, new LST population would be used for the input for capital calculation. (LST CEM calculator) so that balance sheet reporting and capital reporting would be consistent. ","ISG Pending Trades, Frees and Long Settled Trades are booked

Letters of credit are often used in international transactions to ensure that payment will be received. Due to the nature of international dealings including factors such as distance, differing laws in each country and difficulty in knowing each party personally, the use of letters of credit has become a very important aspect of international trade.
