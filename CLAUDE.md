# Claude Code Agent Instructions

This file provides instructions for Claude Code and other AI assistants working on the Morphir Go project.

For complete development guidelines, coding standards, and contribution practices, please refer to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Quick Reference

- **Functional Programming First**: This codebase follows functional programming principles
- **TDD/BDD**: Write tests before implementation
- **No AI Co-Authors**: Do not add Claude or other AI assistants as commit co-authors (breaks EasyCLA)
- **Morphir Alignment**: Maintain compatibility with Morphir IR specification

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed guidelines.
